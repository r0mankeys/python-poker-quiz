## Description

A very simple python quiz game that tests your poker knowledge.

( Don't look at the code if you want to play the game, it will spoil the fun! )

## How to play

1) Make sure you have python installed on your machine (_this program uses python3 but it should work on older versions of python as well_). If you have a mac, you already have python installed but still check your python version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 --version
## Output: Python 3.8.2 (or proabably higher)
```

2) Clone this repository into the directory of your choice

3) Run the following command and enjoy:

```bash
python3 poker_quiz.py
```
